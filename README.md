# Goal-Tracker-Website
This website was built to learn React. 

It works but needs heavy optimization.

# What I learned
-Devolped a website using the React Library to track goals over periods of time.

-Learned how mutation works and usage of functions that don't mutate.

-Learned React Lifecycle Methods such as componentDidMount and shouldComponentUpdate for utility and optimization.



# TODO:

Remove all object mutation.

-Implment Immutable JS or use functions that dont mutate. 

Add shouldComponentUpdate after removal of all mutation.

Add TODO Tracker
