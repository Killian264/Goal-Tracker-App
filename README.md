This website was made to learn react and improve my C# skills. The front-end is made using react and the API is made using C#.

The API is live on azure servers and encryption has been added. For security reasons it will no longer receive updates.

# What I learned React #
-Javascript object mutation and avoidance for easy component updates and predictable results.

-React Lifecycle Methods such as componentDidMount and shouldComponentUpdate for utility and optimization.

-React router to have multiple pages with no loading needed.

-Linting for best practices and naming conventions.

-Fetching from an API asynchronously with loading react loading animations.

-API tokens and storage, cookies on the front-end for continual use without needing to log back in .
# What I learned C# API #
 
-Restful API design and implementation with GET, PULL, DELETE, and PATCH requests.

-User sessions with API tokens and authentication.

-Encryption hashing and salting passwords.

-SQL database design and implementation. Relational databases and design.

-Cloud hosting using azure.
