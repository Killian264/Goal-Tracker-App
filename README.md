This website was made to learn React and improve my C# skills.

The API is live on Azure servers and encryption has been added, but for security reasons it will no longer receive updates on Github.

# What I learned React #
-Javascript object mutation and avoidance for easy component updates and predictable results.

-React router to have multiple pages with no loading needed.

-API tokens and storage, cookies on the front-end for continual use without needing to log back in .

-React Lifecycle Methods such as componentDidMount and shouldComponentUpdate for utility and optimization.

-Linting for best practices and naming conventions.

-Fetching from an API asynchronously with loading animations.

# What I learned C# API #
 
-Restful API design and implementation with GET, PULL, DELETE, and PATCH requests.

-User sessions with API tokens and authentication.

-Encryption hashing and salting passwords.

-SQL database design and implementation. Relational databases design.

-Cloud hosting using Azure.

# TODO: #
Add more pages.
